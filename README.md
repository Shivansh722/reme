# RE:ME - Application Development Documentation

## Project Overview

**RE:ME** is a modern Flutter application built with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and performance. The application follows industry best practices for architecture, employs efficient state management, and provides a robust authentication system with multiple sign-in methods.

## Architecture & Code Structure

### Folder Structure

The project follows a feature-first architecture, which organizes code based on features rather than technical concerns:

```
lib/
├── assets/              # Static resources like images
├── core/                # Core functionality and theme configuration
│   └── theme/           # Application theming
├── src/                 # Source code
│   ├── features/        # Feature modules
│   │   ├── auth/        # Authentication feature
│   │   │   ├── services/# Authentication services
│   │   │   └── Views/   # Authentication UI screens
│   │   └── home/        # Home feature
│   ├── helpers/         # Utility helper functions
│   └── widgets/         # Reusable UI components
└── main.dart            # Application entry point
```

This structure offers several advantages:
- **Modularity**: Each feature is self-contained, making the codebase more maintainable
- **Scalability**: New features can be added without modifying existing code
- **Testability**: Features can be tested in isolation
- **Collaboration**: Team members can work on different features simultaneously

### Code Organization Examples

#### Widgets as Reusable Components

Our custom widgets are designed to be highly reusable across the application:

```dart
// Example of a reusable button component
class Custombutton extends StatelessWidget {
  final String text;
  final void Function()? onTap;
  
  const Custombutton({
    required this.text, 
    required this.onTap,
  });
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Implementation that follows design system guidelines
  }
}
```

#### Separation of Concerns

The code strictly separates UI, business logic, and data access:

- **Views**: Handle UI rendering and user interactions
- **Services**: Manage business logic and external service integration
- **Models**: Define data structures used throughout the app

## Authentication System

RE:ME implements a comprehensive authentication system with multiple sign-in methods:

### 1. Email & Password Authentication

```dart
// Example from the authentication service
void registerUser() async {
  try {
    UserCredential? userCredential = await FirebaseAuth.instance.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(
      email: emailController.text,
      password: passwordController.text,
    );
    // Handle successful registration
  } on FirebaseAuthException catch (e) {
    // Handle specific Firebase authentication errors
    showErrorMessage(context, e.message.toString());
  }
}
```

### 2. Social Authentication

The app supports multiple social authentication methods:

#### Google Sign-In

```dart
// Clean implementation in AuthService
signInWithGoogle() async {
  // Begin interactive sign-in with Google
  final GoogleSignInAccount? gUser = await GoogleSignIn().signIn();
  
  // Obtain auth details from request
  final GoogleSignInAuthentication gAuth = await gUser!.authentication;
  
  // Create a new credential for user
  final credential = GoogleAuthProvider.credential(
    accessToken: gAuth.accessToken,
    idToken: gAuth.idToken,
  );

  // Finally, sign in with Firebase
  return await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithCredential(credential);
}
```

#### LINE Sign-In

```dart
// LINE authentication implementation
Future<LoginResult> signInWithLine() async {
  try {
    final result = await LineSDK.instance.login(
      scopes: ["profile", "openid", "email"]
    );
    
    // Process successful login
    return result;
  } on PlatformException catch (e) {
    // Handle platform-specific exceptions
    throw e.toString();
  }
}
```

### 3. Authentication State Management

The app uses Firebase's `authStateChanges` stream to manage authentication state:

```dart
// Authentication gate implementation
StreamBuilder(
  stream: FirebaseAuth.instance.authStateChanges(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    // User is logged in
    if(snapshot.hasData) {
      return const HomeView(); 
    } else {
      // User not logged in
      return const LoginOrRegister();
    }
  },
)
```

This pattern ensures:
- **Real-time updates**: UI reflects the current authentication state
- **Persistence**: Authentication state is maintained across app restarts
- **Security**: Protected routes are only accessible to authenticated users

## Performance Optimizations

The application implements several performance optimizations:

### 1. Stateful Widget Management

Widgets are carefully designed to minimize unnecessary rebuilds:

```dart
// Toggle between login and register views without rebuilding the entire tree
void toggleView() {
  setState(() {
    showLoginView = !showLoginView;
  });
}
```

### 2. Asynchronous Operations

All network and database operations are performed asynchronously to maintain UI responsiveness:

```dart
// Example of proper async/await pattern with error handling
void login() async {
  // Show loading indicator
  showDialog(...);
  
  try {
    await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithEmailAndPassword(...);
    // Handle success
  } on FirebaseAuthException catch (e) {
    // Handle errors
  } finally {
    // Clean up resources
  }
}
```

### 3. Context Management

The code follows best practices for context management to prevent memory leaks:

```dart
// Checking if context is still valid before using it
if (context.mounted) {
  Navigator.pop(context);
}
```

## Security Measures

The application implements several security best practices:

1. **Input validation**: User inputs are validated before processing
2. **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling to prevent application crashes
3. **Authentication tokens**: Secure handling of authentication tokens
4. **Platform-specific configurations**: Security settings tailored for each platform

## Cross-Platform Support

RE:ME is built to run seamlessly on multiple platforms:

- **iOS**: Configured with proper CocoaPods integration and LINE SDK setup
- **Android**: Optimized with proper manifest configurations for authentication
- **Web**: Support for web-specific authentication flows
- **Desktop**: Basic support for desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Development Workflow

### 1. Version Control

- **Git**: Used for version control with feature branches
- **Pull Requests**: Code reviews are performed for all changes

### 2. CI/CD

- **Automated Testing**: Unit and widget tests are run automatically
- **Code Quality**: Linting and static analysis enforce code standards

### 3. Documentation

- **Code Documentation**: Well-documented code with clear comments
- **API Documentation**: Documentation for all public APIs
- **Developer Guides**: Step-by-step guides for common tasks
